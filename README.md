A set of optimization codes based on Genetic Algorithm
Binary GA: Single objective unconstrained GA with binary chromosomes
Real GA: Single objective unconstrained GA with chromosomes consisting of real numbers
NSGA-II: Multi-objective Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm, both constrained and unconstrained
Pareto fronts: Some Pareto fronts as a result of running code on benchmark problems
